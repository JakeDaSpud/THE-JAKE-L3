let's get this started!
the book teaches POLITE but not OVERFORMAL japanese

lesson 01 learnings:
- こんにちは。konnichiwa
  - hello
- おはようございます。ohayou gozaimasu
  - good morning
- こんばんは。konbanwa
  - good evening
- 私の名前は...です。watashi no namae wa ... desu
  - my name is ...
- どうぞ、よろしく。dohzo yoroshiku
  - pleased to meet you
- さようなら。sayohnara
  - goodbye (formal)
- さよなら。sayonara
  - goodbye (informal)
- ではまたあした。dewa mata ashita
  - see you tomorrow

notes:
- i didn't know there were 2 forms of sayonara, which i already know isn't widely used anyways, interesting.
- there's a different comma in どうぞ、よろしく there´s a ´、´ character.
